# CuriousTinker
CuriousTinker is a personal repository of my Software Engineering journey, featuring handwritten notes, visual explanations, and curated resources on Web Development, System Design, DSA, Cloud Computing, and more. As a visual learner, I organize concepts for better understanding while crediting original sources.
